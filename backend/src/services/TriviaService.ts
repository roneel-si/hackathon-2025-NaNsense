        Original Query: "${rawQuery}"
        
        INTELLIGENT CLEANING RULES:
        1. ANALYZE each term to determine if it's cricket-related:
           - Famous cricket nicknames (Little Master, Captain Cool, Hitman, etc.) ‚Üí KEEP
           - Official player names ‚Üí KEEP  
           - Team names and abbreviations ‚Üí EXPAND (CSK ‚Üí Chennai Super Kings)
           - Cricket terminology ‚Üí KEEP (centuries, wickets, boundaries, etc.)
           - Tournament names ‚Üí STANDARDIZE (World Cup, IPL, T20, etc.)
           - Non-cricket personal names ‚Üí REMOVE
        
        2. Use your cricket knowledge to identify:
           - Player nicknames from any era of cricket
           - Team nicknames (Men in Blue, Proteas, etc.)
           - Cricket positions and roles
           - Cricket formats and tournaments
           - Cricket venues and grounds
        
        3. Fix spelling mistakes and standardize formats
        
        4. Remove only terms that are clearly NOT related to cricket
        
        DECISION PROCESS:
        - If unsure whether a term is cricket-related, KEEP it (better safe than sorry)
        - Focus on removing obviously non-cricket entities
        - Preserve cricket context and terminology
        
        EXAMPLES:
        - "little master highest score" ‚Üí "Little Master highest score" (cricket nickname)
        - "captain cool IPL wins" ‚Üí "Captain Cool IPL wins" (cricket nickname)  
        - "kolkota knight riders" ‚Üí "Kolkata Knight Riders" (fix spelling)
        - "highest score by rinston" ‚Üí "highest score" (remove non-cricket name)
        - "CSK vs MI 2023" ‚Üí "Chennai Super Kings vs Mumbai Indians 2023"
        - "boom boom afridi sixes" ‚Üí "Boom Boom Afridi sixes" (cricket nickname)
