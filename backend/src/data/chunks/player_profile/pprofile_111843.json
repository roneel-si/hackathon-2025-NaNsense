  "bio": "Swastik Chikara, a promising right-handed batter from Ghaziabad, has been making waves in domestic cricket. His adaptability across formats and aggressive stroke play make him a formidable force in the T20 format. Adding another dimension to his game, Chikara’s off-break bowling provides an extra option for his team, potentially shaping him into a valuable all-rounder in the future. Chikara’s standout performance in the 2024 Uttar Pradesh T20 League cemented his reputation as a rising star. Amassing 499 runs in 12 innings at a stellar average of 49.90 and an explosive strike rate of 185.50, he dominated the tournament, finishing as the leading run-scorer. His highest score of 114 against the Gorakhpur Lions showcased his ability to both anchor innings and accelerate when needed. With a century and five fifties to his name, he played a crucial role in Meerut Mavericks’ title-winning campaign. With his fearless approach and versatility, Chikara was always going to be a sought-after player at the 2025 Indian Premier League auction. Recognising his potential, Bengaluru secured his services for the 2025 season, acquiring him for INR 30 lakh.",
