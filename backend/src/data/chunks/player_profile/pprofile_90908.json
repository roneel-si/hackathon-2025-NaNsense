  "bio": "Kwena Maphaka is a promising South African fast bowler who made headlines with his impressive performances at the Under-19 level. A left-arm pacer known for his pace, swing, and ability to generate bounce, Maphaka rose to prominence during the 2024 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup, where he finished as the tournament's highest wicket-taker with 21 wickets in six matches. His dominant performances, including multiple four-wicket hauls, were instrumental in South Africaâ€™s run to the semi-finals, and he was deservedly named the Player of the Tournament. Following his success at the U-19 level, Maphaka quickly transitioned into senior cricket. Later in 2024, he made his white-ball debuts for South Africa, before earning his Test cap in early 2025. His growing reputation, combined with strong domestic performances, saw him land a contract with Mumbai for the 2024 Indian Premier League. However, his debut against Hyderabad turned into a tough initiation, as he went wicketless and conceded 66 runs in four overs. His struggles continued into 2025, where he represented Paarl in the SA20 and endured an underwhelming season. Ahead of the 2025 IPL auction, Mumbai released him but Rajasthan saw potential in the young pacer and secured his services.",
