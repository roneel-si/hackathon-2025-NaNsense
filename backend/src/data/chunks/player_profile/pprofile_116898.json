  "bio": "Prince Chaudhary is an Indian cricketer known for mystery spin bowling. His cricketing journey began at the tender age of 12 at the local grounds in Delhi. His uncle who is a cricket enthusiast saw his talent and put him under a coaching programme which proved to be a life-changing decision. He idolizes legendary India leg-spinner, Anil Kumble which serves as motivation to keep looking for perfection. His first breakthrough came in 2015 when he played for the U-14 Delhi side. He rose through the ranks and was a consistent member of the youth domestic side. He took the cricket world by storm with an exceptional performance in a DDCA league match. He took 9 wickets in one game and the only one that he couldn't get was a run out. This did not go unnoticed and he was bought by Punjab for the 2024 Indian Premier League. After this amazing achievement, he also made his first-class debut in 2024. Choudhary also follows Rashid Khan a lot and looks forward to crossing paths with him and gaining valuable insights. His story from the local grounds to the biggest league is a testament to his resilience and passion for the game.",
