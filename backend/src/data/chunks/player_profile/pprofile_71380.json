  "bio": "Sushant Mishra, born 23rd December 2000, hailing from Ranchi, is a rising star in Indian cricket. This left-arm fast-medium bowler honed his skill under the guidance of Rahul David in his junior years. He was selected for the 2020 Under-19 Cricket World Cup. He had a very successful campaign in the u-19 World Cup as he bagged seven wickets at an average of 19.85 and helped his nation win the World Cup. It also included a three-wicket haul against Pakistan. His performance stole the newspaper headlines and which impressed the selectors of Jharkhand. He further debuted in List A against Delhi in Mohali for the 2021-22 Vijay Hazare Trophy in the month of December 2021. After a few months, he made his first-class debut in February 2022 for Jharkhand in the 2021-22 Ranji Trophy. He played his first match against Chhattisgarh and bagged 6 wickets including both innings but ended up being in the losing side. He continued his exceptional performance in domestic cricket and picked up more than 20 wickets in just seven first-class matches. The jaw-dropped performance reached the ears of selectors of Indian Premier League franchises. His base price for the auction of the 2024 Indian Premier League was INR 20 Lakhs which piled up to INR 2.20 Cr. Ultimately Gujarat stayed in the race and signed Mishra. It would be pretty exciting to see how Gujarat uses Mishra in the starting line-up.",
