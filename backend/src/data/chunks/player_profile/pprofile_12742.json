  "bio": "India has been known to produce some of the best spinners in the world of cricket. Tanay Thyagarajan is no different, with his left-arm orthodox spin bowling, he has been exceptional in the domestic circuit. His entry to cricket was more by chance when after a day in school, he was asked to throw a few balls by the coach, but he has never looked back since. He made his first-class debut for Hyderabad in the 2018-19 Ranji Trophy and was brilliant as he finished as the leading wicket-taker for them with 17 scalps in five games. Before that, he already played List A and T20 cricket for the state. Since then, he has been a consistent performer for Hyderabad across all formats. He enjoyed a stellar 2023-24 season, where in the Ranji Trophy, he scalped a whopping 56 wickets in seven matches including 7 five-wicket hauls. This caught the eye of the selectors, and he was roped in by Punjab for the 2024 Indian Premier League. His handy left-handed batting down the order along with his sensational bowling form could turn out as a surprise package in the upcoming season of the toughest T20 league in the world.",
