  "bio": "Prerak Mankad is an Indian cricketer who plays regularly for Saurashtra in the Indian domestic scene. Born on 23rd April 1994 in Sirohi in the Saurashtra region of Gujarat, Prerak is a high utility player who bats right-handed and can also bowl some useful medium pace which makes him an asset to have on any team. He made his T20 debut in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy at the start of 2016 and though he did not get to bat, he claimed 2 wickets for 27 runs in his four overs contributing to his team's win. In the next month, he made his first-class debut against Mumbai in the 2016-17 Ranji Trophy scoring 66 runs in the first outing. The following year in 2017, he made his List A debut and scored another brilliant fifty to make his mark. He managed to cement his spot in the domestic team in all three formats and has been a consistent performer for Saurashtra with both bat and ball. He smashed a 25-ball 66 in the semi-final of the 2022 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and this paved the way for bigger things. After looking at his domestic exploits, he was bought by the Punjab franchise in the mega auction for the 2022 Indian T20 League but he could only get one game and was released by the team. The Lucknow franchise picked him up for the 2023 edition and he will hope to get a few more opportunities to showcase his talent on this massive stage.",
