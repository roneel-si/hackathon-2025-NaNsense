  "bio": "An experienced campaigner in the Indian domestic circuit, Pavan Deshpande is a first-class cricketer who plays for Karnataka. He made his First-Class debut in the 2016-17 Ranji Trophy season, playing against Maharashtra in December. His List A debut followed soon as he made his bow against Jharkhand in February 2017. A left-handed batsman who can also bowl part-time off-break, Pavan Deshpande was first drafted in the domestic T20 circuit when he made his debut versus Kerala in the 2015 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. He hit his best form in 2017-18 season of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. That was followed up in the Vijay Hazare Trophy as well, which eventually helped him secure a move to the Bangalore-based franchise in the Indian T20 League in 2018. Pavan was again bought by the Bangalore-based franchise in the 2020 auctions of the Indian T20 League for a base price of 20 lakh INR.",
