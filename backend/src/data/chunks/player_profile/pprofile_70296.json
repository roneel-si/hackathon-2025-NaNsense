  "bio": "Rasikh Salam, a promising fast bowler from Jammu and Kashmir, has carved a path in Indian cricket with his ability to generate pace and swing. Rasikh first grabbed attention when Mumbai picked him up for the 2019 Indian Premier League. However, his career hit a roadblock when he was handed a two-year suspension by the BCCI due to discrepancies in birth certificate. Determined to make a comeback, he worked his way back into domestic cricket in 2021. Strong performances in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and Vijay Hazare Trophy earned him an IPL contract with Kolkata in 2022. However, just two games into the season, a lower back injury sidelined him for the rest of the campaign. He returned to competitive cricket during the 2023-24 domestic season. His resurgence caught the attention of Delhi, who signed him for the 2024 IPL, where he delivered an impressive showing. Rasikh’s performances in the IPL led to his selection in India’s squad for the 2024 Emerging T20 Asia Cup in Oman, where he was the standout bowler despite the team’s semifinal exit. Released by Delhi ahead of the 2025 auction, he sparked a bidding war and was eventually snapped up by Bengaluru for a hefty INR 6 crore, highlighting his growing reputation as a rising fast-bowling talent.",
