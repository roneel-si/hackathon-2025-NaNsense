  "bio": "Arpit Guleria is a right-arm fast bowler who has consistently performed in the domestic circuit and hit the jackpot when he earned a contract to play in the 2023 Indian T20 League. Born on 26th April 1997 in Kangra in Himachal Pradesh, he made his first-class debut for his state in the 2018-19 Ranji Trophy towards the end of 2018 and picked up three wickets in his first outing. He made his List A debut almost a year later for Himachal Pradesh in the Vijay Hazare Trophy. In this game, they lost by a narrow margin but Arpit ended up with excellent figures of 9-1-24-2 which included the wicket of Ruturaj Gaikwad and Maharashtra's skipper, Kedar Jadhav. He currently plies his trade for Services domestically and has been recruited by the Lucknow franchise for the 2023 edition of the Indian T20 League as a like-for-like replacement for the injured Mayank Yadav at his base price of INR 20 lakh. Arpit is also a useful lower-order batter and he will be hoping to prove himself as he shares the dressing room with some of the biggest cricketing names in the world.",
