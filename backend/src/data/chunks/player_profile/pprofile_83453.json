  "bio": "Hailing from Yavatmal, Shubham Dubey is an explosive left-handed batter known for his aggressive stroke play. His journey began with Vidarbha, where he made his T20 debut in 2021. In List A cricket, Dubey has maintained a solid average, with his strike rate highlighting his ability to accelerate when needed, an invaluable trait in modern cricket. Dubey has particularly excelled in T20s, establishing himself as a powerful striker who can clear the boundary with ease. His performances in domestic cricket have been impressive, with a standout display in the 2023 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, where he amassed 221 runs in 7 innings at a strike rate of 187.28. His exploits caught the attention of IPL franchises, and Rajasthan secured his services for INR 5.8 crore ahead of the 2024 season. Though he had limited opportunities in IPL 2024, Dubey made a strong impression. However, Rajasthan decided to release him before the 2025 auction, only to bid for him again and successfully reclaim him.",
