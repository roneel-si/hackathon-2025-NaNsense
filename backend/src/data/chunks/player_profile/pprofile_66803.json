  "bio": "A household name now in Indian cricket, Priyam Garg was the skipper when India lost to Bangladesh in the ICC U19 ODI World Cup final in 2020. He is a stylish and elegant right-handed batsman who looks set to take the Indian cricketing stage by storm. A player born in the 2000s, Garg made his List A debut for Uttar Pradesh in the Vijay Hazare Trophy in September 2018 followed by his First-Class debut in the Ranji Trophy in November 2018. He made a statement of intent in December of that year as he scored a double ton against Tripura. Garg made his Twenty20 debut for his domestic team in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy in February 2019. In 2019, Garg made the step up on the cricketing ladder as he made his debut in the Duleep Trophy and Deodhar Trophy. With the ICC U19 World Cup 2020 approaching in South Africa, Priyam Garg was appointed as the skipper of the U19 team. He took his side all the way to the finals of the tournament but they faltered at the final hurdle as Bangladesh defeated them to win their first World Cup. However, before the tournament, he was bought by the Hyderabad-based franchise in the Indian T20 League for Rs. 1.90 crore. The whole nation will have its eyes on him as he has succeeded the likes of Virat Kohli and Prithvi Shaw in the U19 fold.",
