  "bio": "Mohit Rathee, an all-rounder from Rohtak in Haryana, has carved his path from club cricket to the professional stage with determination and skill. A leg-spinner who can contribute with the bat, Rathee has the potential to develop further by learning from seasoned international players in the dressing room. His domestic journey began with a first-class debut for Services in 2022. Interestingly, he had not played a T20 match before making his Indian Premier League debut. Despite this, Punjab saw promise in him and picked him up for the 2023 season. Rathee played just one game that year, bowling two overs and conceding 29 runs in what was a challenging debut. Later that year, he finally made his T20 debut for Services in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, getting limited opportunities over the next couple of seasons. After his stint with Punjab ended, he re-entered the auction for the 2025 IPL, where Bengaluru secured his services.",
