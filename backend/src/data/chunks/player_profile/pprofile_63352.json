  "bio": "Ankit Rajpoot is a right-arm pacer from Uttar Pradesh who made his first-class debut for Uttar Pradesh in 2012. He came into limelight with his spell of 6/68 against Haryana. He picked up 31 wickets in the seven first-class matches in 2012-13 Ranji Trophy season leading to him being signed by Chennai Super Kings for the Indian T20 League season 6. Later on, Rajput was a part of Kolkata and Punjab in the prestigious League. The latter in fact spent a whopping INR 3 crore to acquire his services in the 2018 auction. The pacer proved his worth by picking a 5-wicket haul against Hyderabad which also was the best bowling effort by an uncapped bowler then. For the 13th edition of the League, Ankit was traded to Rajasthan as Punjab swapped him with Krishnappa Gowtham.",
