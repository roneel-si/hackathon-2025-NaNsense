  "bio": "Shivam Mavi is an upcoming pace bowler for India who shot to fame during the 2018 U19 World Cup. He managed to impress one and all with his raw pace and was signed by Kolkata for the Indian T20 League in that year. However, injury marred his progress and his career was stalled. Since recovering from a stress fracture in his back, Mavi has played domestic cricket for Uttar Pradesh. The most notable moment for him thus far has been picking a hat-trick against Saurashtra on the opening day of the 2018-19 Vijay Hazare Trophy. The young pacer has all the ability to succeed if he manages to stay fit.",
