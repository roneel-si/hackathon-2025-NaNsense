  "bio": "Kumar Kartikeya’s journey to professional cricket is a testament to perseverance and resilience. Born in Sultanpur, Uttar Pradesh, Kartikeya left home at a young age to chase his cricketing dreams in Madhya Pradesh. Facing financial hardships, he worked at a factory to support himself while training tirelessly to hone his skills. Kartikeya made his domestic debut for Madhya Pradesh in the 2018-19 season and quickly gained recognition for his performances in the Ranji Trophy and Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. Originally a traditional left-arm orthodox spinner, he expanded his repertoire by learning wrist spin and variations, making him a more dynamic bowler. His breakthrough moment came in IPL 2022, when Mumbai signed him as a mid-season replacement for Arshad Khan. He impressed immediately with his control and adaptability, earning praise for his bowling depth. Later that year, he played a pivotal role in Madhya Pradesh’s Ranji Trophy triumph, finishing as the team’s leading wicket-taker with 32 scalps. Buoyed by his promise, Mumbai retained Kartikeya for the 2023 season, where he received more opportunities but struggled to meet expectations. Despite an underwhelming season, the franchise showed faith by retaining him for IPL 2024, but he failed to break into the playing XI and was subsequently released. Ahead of the 2025 auction, Rajasthan picked him up.",
