  "bio": "Born in Barbados, Chris Jordan is a right-arm fast bowling prospect who shifted base to Dulwich College after obtaining a sporting scholarship. At 18 years old, he was already making his way into the Surrey playing XI against Middlesex in 2007. Jordan bowls in the mid-80's range. He received the NBC Denis Compton Award for Surrey's most promising player in 2007. He made his first-class debut against Kent for Surrey but moved to Barbados before returning back to England but this time, he came to Sussex to try his luck and made an impression immediately with a six-fer on debut against Yorkshire. He was eligible to play for both England and West Indies but he chose the former with his grandmother's roots and finally made his debut against Australia in the final ODI of the five-match series in 2013.",
