  "bio": "Bavanaka Sandeep is a batting all-rounder who has been playing domestically for almost a decade in India for Hyderabad. He is a slow left-arm orthodox bowler as well who chips in with a few wickets every now and then. Sandeep had a mediocre career until 2017 but in the 2017/18 Ranji Trophy season, his career took off as he scored 400 runs in four matches, becoming the leading run-scorer for Hyderabad. In July 2018, Sandeep was named in the India Red squad for the 2018/19 Duleep Trophy. In November 2018, Bavanaka reached another milestone when he completed 3000 First-Class runs. In the 2020 IPL auctions, a once in a lifetime moment came in Sandeep's life as he was bought by the Hyderabad-based franchise in the Indian T20 League for 20 Lakh INR. He will be looking to make his mark in one of the biggest T20 leagues in the world.",
