  "bio": "Keemo Paul was trending on social media back in 2016, but not for the right reasons. He was involved in a Mankading incident while he was playing for West Indies during the U-19 World Cup in 2016. Paul got rid of a Zimbabwean batter, which secured a top two stop in the group table and eventually, West Indies went on to win the tournament. Along with all the drama on social media, people also came across his cricketing talent that truly could not have gone unnoticed. Paul is an all-rounder who took seven wickets and smashed 166 runs with the bat during the U-19 World Cup. Paul later got exposed to the domestic circuit and grew as a player. In 2018, Keemo Paul got selected for West Indies and made his debut in all three formats in the same here. He has been a part of the Guyana team in the CPL and also represents Hobart in the Big Bash League. A handy all-rounder like him will always be an asset for any team.",
