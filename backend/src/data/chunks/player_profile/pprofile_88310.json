  "bio": "Aravelly Avanish, born on June 2, 2005, is a young and rising wicket-keeper batter. Hailing from Hyderabad, the 18-year-old sensation has already established himself as a formidable force in the middle-order. In the Vinoo Mankad Trophy of 2023, he showcased his prowess by amassing 274 runs in 6 innings with an impressive strike rate of 148.10, the highest among batters who scored over 200 runs in the competition. Avanish recently made his List A debut for Hyderabad. Nonetheless, he is recognized as a player with immense potential. Having represented India in the U19 Asia Cup, he is now poised to take on the role of India's primary wicket-keeper at the U19 World Cup in South Africa, further solidifying his status as one to watch. Aravelly Avanish, a dynamic left-handed wicket-keeper batter who typically occupies the middle-order position, captured attention recently with his remarkable performance during a game in the Quadrangular series. Despite India 'A' U19 struggling at 95/5 while chasing 376, Avanish displayed superhuman prowess by smashing 163 runs off only 93 deliveries, steering his team to victory. His extraordinary innings included a stunning display of power hitting, as he launched 12 sixes. With this performance, it was just a formality that any team would pick him up in the Indian Premier League. The Chennai management swiftly acquired him as soon as his name popped in the 2024 auction. His commitment and consistency will be a key factor for his bright future.",
