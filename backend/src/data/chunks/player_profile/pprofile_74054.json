  "bio": "The recent emergence of fast bowlers in India has taken the cricketing world by storm. Born on 13th September 1997, Yudhvir Singh is a right-arm fast bowler from Jammu who made his T20 and first-class debuts towards the end of 2019 for Hyderabad. He decided to return to his home state and played for Jammu and Kashmir in 2021, where he made his List A debut. Courtesy of some strong performances in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, he was recruited by the Mumbai franchise for the 2021 Indian Premier League. He missed the following season but was signed by the Lucknow side for the 2023 edition. Even though Lucknow lost that game against Punjab, Yudhvir Singh made an impression on his IPL debut. He featured in only a couple of matches more but showed enough promise for the franchise to retain him for the 2024 season. However, opportunities remained scarce, and he couldn’t make much of an impact. Later that year, during the Ranji Trophy season, Yudhvir had a breakthrough campaign, picking up 26 wickets from 7 games. One of his standout performances came against powerhouse Mumbai, where Jammu and Kashmir pulled off an upset, thanks to Yudhvir’s Man of the Match-winning 7-wicket haul. His talent and promise were evident for all to see, and Rajasthan had no hesitation in securing his services at the 2025 IPL auction.",
