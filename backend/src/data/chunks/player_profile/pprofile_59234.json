  "bio": "Baltej Singh is a right-arm medium-pace bowler who plies his trade for the Punjab cricket team in the domestic circuit and is a part of the Punjab franchise in the Indian T20 League. Born on 4th November 1990, he made his first-class debut against Karnataka in the Ranji Trophy Elite at the end of 2011 but went wicketless in the whole game. It took him three more years to make his List A debut towards the end of 2014 against Haryana in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, where he was slightly expensive but claimed a solitary wicket. He seemed to have found his favored format when he made his T20 debut in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy against Rajasthan at the start of 2016 and made a good impression taking two wickets for 29 runs in his four overs. He got his big break when he was picked by the Punjab franchise for his base price to be a part of the squad for the 2022 Indian T20 League. He did not make a single appearance and was released at the end of the tournament but was bought for his base price once again for the 2023 edition. He will be hoping to get his opportunity and make a mark on this massive stage.",
