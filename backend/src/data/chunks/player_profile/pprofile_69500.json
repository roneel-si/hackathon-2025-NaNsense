  "bio": "Sai Sudharsan, born on October 15, 2001, is an Indian cricketer making waves in domestic and international circles. Hailing from Chennai, this southpaw batter has impressed with his elegant strokeplay and growing maturity at the crease. Recognized for his talent during his junior years, Sudharsan represented Tamil Nadu in various age-group tournaments. In 2021, he made his senior debut and quickly demonstrated his versatility across formats. He debuted for Tamil Nadu in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy T20 competition and subsequently made his List A debut in the Vijay Hazare Trophy. Known for his clean hitting and ability to play shots all around the wicket, Sudharsan also possesses a calm temperament, which helps him build partnerships and adapt to different situations. His elegant yet powerful drives and deft flicks are a delight to watch. Sudharsan's heroics in the Tamil Nadu Premier League earned him a spot in the Gujarat squad during the 2022 Indian Premier League auction, where he was picked for the base price of INR 20 Lakhs. Although he did not get many opportunities in his debut season, he gained valuable experience training alongside seasoned professionals and was part of the team that won the championship in Gujarat's debut IPL season. In the 2023 IPL season, Sudharsan averaged an impressive 51.71, scoring 362 runs. He played a standout innings of 96 runs in the final against the Chennai, finishing as the top scorer of the match, although Gujarat lost the title clash. That same year, Sudharsan signed with Surrey for the final three matches of the County Championship, further broadening his cricketing exposure. The 2023 Tamil Nadu Premier League proved to be a breakthrough season for Sudharsan, as he amassed an incredible 371 runs in six matches. On July 4, 2023, Sudharsan received a call-up to the India A team for the ACC Emerging Teams Asia Cup. On July 14, 2023, he was announced as one of the standby players for the Indian squad competing in the 19th Asian Games in Hangzhou. In the Emerging Asia Cup match between India A and Pakistan A on July 19, 2023, Sudharsan struck an unbeaten 104 off 110 deliveries, leading India A to a decisive victory. A few months later, Sudharsan made his ODI debut for the Indian national team. He scored an unbeaten 55 in his first outing against South Africa and followed it up with another half-century, helping India clinch the series. In the 2024/25 season of the Ranji Trophy, Sai Sudharsan scored his maiden double century, leading Tamil Nadu to a dominant win against a strong Delhi side. However, he had to miss the sixth and seventh rounds of the group stage due to an injury. Sudharsan has been consistent with the bat in domestic cricket and for GT. His performances in the 2024 IPL season were impressive, as he scored 527 runs at a healthy average of 47, including a century and a couple of fifties. Given his stellar form, GT decided to retain the 24-year-old southpaw for the 2025 IPL season.",
