  "bio": "A player who has been likened to Indian ace Ravindra Jadeja, Sanjay Yadav is a left-handed batting all-rounder who plays for Tamil Nadu in the Indian domestic circuit. He is also a slow left-arm orthodox bowler and has made huge strides with his bowling as well. Sanjay Yadav came to the fore when he was bought by the Kolkata-based franchise in the Indian T20 League in 2017 for Rs. 10 Lakh. However, he was not able to break into the playing XI and instead was playing much more cricket in the domestic circuit. 2019 was the breakthrough year for him when he moved to the Meghalaya cricket team ahead of the 2019/20 season. Sanjay made his List A debut on 24th September 2019, for Meghalaya in the 2019/20 Vijay Hazare Trophy. That was followed by his First-Class debut in December 2019 in the Ranji Trophy. He made it a memorable one as he scored 61 runs with the bat but more importantly, he recorded figures of 22-7-52-9 in the first innings of the match. They were the third-best figures in Indian domestic FC cricket. It will be interesting to see what the future holds for the Uttar Pradesh-born star and how he will perform in his future games.",
