  "bio": "Karan Sharma is a talented all-rounder coming through the ranks of Indian cricket. Born on 31st October 1998, the right-handed batter is also able to bowl some decent off-breaks. Like other modern-day Indian players, he made his T20 debut in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy for Uttar Pradesh in 2021. He also played his first List A game that year, scoring 40 runs before running himself out. He made his first-class debut the following year and captained Uttar Pradesh in that game. Karan has a good record at the domestic level, and with his all-round abilities, he is an asset for any team. He received a contract from the Lucknow franchise in the 2022 Indian T20 League but played one game that season. With his skill set and potential in mind, the franchise decided to retain him for the 2023 edition, and with age on his side, there is a lot of room for improvement. He could become a useful all-rounder in the near future and he will be hoping to make his mark on a bigger stage.",
