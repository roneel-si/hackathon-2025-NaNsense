  "bio": "Ashok Sharma, a skilled right-arm medium-fast bowler from Jaipur, has earned recognition for his ability to swing the ball both ways while maintaining a disciplined line and length. His impressive bowling action and consistency caught the attention of the Rajasthan franchise, leading to an invitation for trials, where he was eventually picked as a net bowler. During the 2022 Indian Premier League auction, a bidding war ensued between Kolkata and Rajasthan, with Kolkata securing him for INR 55 lakh. However, he spent the entire season on the bench without getting a game. Sharma's breakthrough came in the 2023 Rajasthan Premier League, where he showcased his wicket-taking ability and delivered under pressure. His adaptability to different pitch conditions and knack for picking up crucial scalps made everyone take notice. Having previously identified his potential during trials and net sessions, Rajasthan made their move in the 2025 IPL auction, securing Sharma for INR 30 lakh. It was no surprise that the inaugural champions backed the young pacer, recognising his promise and ability to make an impact.",
