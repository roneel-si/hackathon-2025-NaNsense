  "bio": "KM Asif is a fast bowler who hails from Kerala. One might wonder how a Malappuram resident is passionate about cricket and took it as his profession rather than football as the city is well known for producing exceptional footballers. Asif made his List A debut in the Vijay Hazare trophy 2017-18 season and although he didn't have enough wickets to his name, he showed great control and accuracy. It impressed the Chennai-based franchise scouting team and they bought him for the 11th edition of the Indian T20 League where he took 3 wickets in 2 matches. Asif is a bright prospect and needs proper attention and opportunities to excel in future.",
