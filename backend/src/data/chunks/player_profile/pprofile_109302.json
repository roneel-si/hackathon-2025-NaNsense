  "bio": "Vishwanath Singh is a young Indian cricketer. He is a right-handed attacking batter who can bowl some useful off-breaks too. He is a late bloomer in cricket but we all know it's better late than ever. Singh played for JK Super Strikers in the Punjab T20 League and was a key player for them. He smashed 430 runs in 11 games including a blazing hundred as well but unfortunately, his team couldn't make it to the final. However, he caught the eye of the scouts and was picked up by Punjab for the 2024 Indian Premier League. He also made his first-class debut for Punjab in 2024. Singh has worked hard for this moment and he will be looking to cherish it with some solid performances in the biggest league in the world.",
