  "bio": "Oshane Thomas is a tall and muscular boy from Jamaica who first got noticed in the 2017 edition of the Caribbean Premier League where he impressed everyone with his express pace and ability to move the ball. Soon he was on the plane to India and made his debut in both the limited-over formats. Thomas intimidated the likes of Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma with his raw pace and earned quite a few admirers. Later that year, Oshane claimed his maiden 5-wicket haul in ODIs against England and also got selected by the Rajasthan franchise for the Indian T20 League. His biggest moment in life though was when he got named in the West Indies' squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup.",
