  "bio": "Harpreet Singh is a talented left-handed batter who has performed consistently in the Indian domestic circuit and is probably unlucky to not have got an opportunity to showcase his talent on a bigger stage. Born on 11th August 1991 in a small village called Dalli Rajhara in Madhya Pradesh, Harpreet made his List A debut for his home state in the Vijay Hazare Trophy at the start of 2008. His performance in the 2008-09 Cooch Behar Trophy where he scored 709 runs in 7 matches earned him the Best Under-19 Cricketer of the Season award and was named as vice-captain for the U19 tour of Australia in 2009 where he accumulated 262 runs at an average of 52.40. He returned and made his first-class debut for Madhya Pradesh against Haryana in the Ranji Trophy Plate League and was named in the squad for the 2010 U19 Men’s World Cup. He was picked by the Kolkata franchise for the 2010 Indian Premier League and played only one game that season which was his T20 debut against the Mumbai franchise. He played a few games for the now-defunct Pune franchise the following year but then found himself without a team for the next few years. In the 2017 Indian Premier League, he went unsold in the auction but was brought in by the Bangalore franchise as a replacement for an injured Sarfaraz Khan. He did not allow the rejections faced in franchise cricket to affect him and continued to toil away in the domestic leagues. He was the leading run-scorer for Madhya Pradesh in the 2017-18 Ranji Trophy making 629 runs in seven games and also the top scored for his side in the Vijay Hazare Trophy that season with 271 runs in five matches. He transferred to Chhattisgarh for the 2018-19 season and was the highest run-getter for his side in the Ranji Trophy with 627 in eight games. His hard work over the years finally bore fruit when the Punjab franchise bought him for the 2023 Indian Premier League and despite a delayed opportunity, this was his chance to make the world stand up and notice him. However, he could get only 3 games and scored 77 runs with his highest being 41.Harpreet Singh is a talented left-handed batter who has performed consistently in the Indian domestic circuit and is probably unlucky to not have got an opportunity to showcase his talent on a bigger stage.

However, he could get only 3 games and scored 77 runs with his highest being 41. Harpreet didn't break into the team, but he did break a league record. Previously held by Matthew Wade with a gap of 3692 days, Harpreet surpassed it with 3981 days, marking the longest interval between two games in the league's history. He performed decently for Chhattisgarh in the 2023 domestic season and was retained by Punjab for the 2024 Indian Premier League. This time though, he will hope to get a few more games to showcase his qualities against some of the best in the world.",
