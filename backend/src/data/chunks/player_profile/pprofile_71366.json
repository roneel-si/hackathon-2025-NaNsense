  "bio": "Priyansh Arya, born on January 18, 2001, in Delhi, India, is a left-handed opening batter and right-arm off-break bowler who has rapidly ascended in the Indian domestic cricket scene. Standing at 5 feet 10 inches and weighing 65 kilograms, Arya's cricketing journey began at the tender age of seven under the mentorship of Sanjay Bharadwaj, who has also coached notable players like Gautam Gambhir and Unmukt Chand. Arya's cricketing prowess came to the forefront during the 2023-24 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy (SMAT), where he emerged as the leading run-scorer for Delhi. Despite registering for the 2024 Indian Premier League (IPL) auction, he went unsold, which only fueled his determination. In the inaugural Delhi Premier League (DPL) T20 in 2024, Arya delivered a stellar performance, amassing 576 runs in eight innings. Notably, he scored an unbeaten 107 against Purani Dilli and a blistering 120 off 50 balls against North Delhi Strikers, during which he hit six sixes in a single over off left-arm spinner Manan Bharadwaj. These remarkable feats caught the attention of IPL scouts, leading to his acquisition by the Punjab for Rs 3.80 crore in the 2025 IPL season. Arya's journey reflects a blend of talent, resilience, and an unwavering commitment to both his sport and personal development.",
