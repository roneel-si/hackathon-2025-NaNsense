  "bio": "Ramandeep Singh, born on April 13, 1997, is an Indian cricketer known for his right-handed batting and part-time medium pace. Hailing from Punjab, Ramandeep’s journey in cricket exemplifies determination and perseverance. He debuted for Punjab in T20 cricket during the 2016–17 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and later progressed to List-A cricket in the 2019–20 Vijay Hazare Trophy, followed by his first-Class debut in the Ranji Trophy. Known for his explosive batting, Ramandeep showcased consistent performances in domestic cricket. His talent caught the eye of IPL scouts, leading to his acquisition by the Mumbai franchise for the 2022 season, where he made a promising impression despite limited opportunities. In 2023, he turned heads with a stellar domestic season, amassing 418 runs in Punjab's T20 competition. This form carried into 2024, during which he joined Kolkata for the IPL. and won the title as well. He was also praised for his exceptional fielding, as he is one of the best fielders the country has produced. Despite batting lower down the order, Ramandeep maximized his opportunities with clean and powerful hitting. His impactful performances in the T20 Emerging Asia Cup later in the year earned him a call-up to the Indian T20I squad, culminating in his debut during the South Africa tour.",
